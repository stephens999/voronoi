The program VORONOI takes input the name of a file 
containing a list of samples to be analysed
and an output filename. The file listing the samples should
first contain the number of samples, and then the sample
numbers.

For example,
4 1 5 6 7
would indicate there are 4 sampels to be analysed, and they are
samples numbered 1, 5, 6 and 7.

The current directory must contain the output of 9 SCAT runs for
these samples, using the "tags" r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y and z. Thus
for the above example the directory shoudl contain files
001r 001s 001t 001u 001v 001w 001x 001y 001z
005r 005s 005t 005u 005v 005w 005x 005y 005z
... etc.


VORONOI shoudl be given a flag -d if the data are savannah, and -D if they are forest.

Example usage: ./VORONOI -d samplelist.txt temp.out

The most important output file produced will be temp.out_indprobs
This contains, for each individual in turn, a 67 by 67 matrix, the ij entry
containing the probability that the individual came from grid cell i,j.
These grid cells are each 1 degree lat by 1 degree longitude, running from
17W to 50E and 36S to 31N. Note that many of these cells are in the Sea!
So there are a lot of 0 probabilities.
