# voronoi
Repository for VORONOI code (related to SCAT).  This is version 2.0
(maintained by Mary Kuhner, mkkuhner@uw.edu).  Version 1 (which had no
version number visible) had multiple serious bugs; we recommend
re-running analyses made using it.

To compile, change to src directory and type "make".

Documentation is in docs directory as voronoi_manual.pdf.
